# CTAssetsPickerController

## Development Suspended (1 June, 2016)

As I am busy on both of my work and personal life, it seems that I have no more spare time to maintain this project in coming year. The development of this project is suspended. Anyone who would like to keep this project running, just fork it. 

## Introduction

CTAssetsPickerController is a highly customisable iOS controller that allows picking multiple photos and videos from user's photo library. The usage and look-and-feel are just similar to UIImagePickerController. It uses **ARC** and requires **Photos** framework.

## Release Notes
* [Release Notes](https://github.com/chiunam/CTAssetsPickerController/releases)

## Minimum Requirement
iOS 9 SDK, Minimum Deployment Target iOS 8.0

## Adding to your project
    	
1. [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) Podfile

    ````
    platform :ios, '8.0'
    pod 'CTAssetsPickerController',  '~> 3.3.0'
    ````
    	
2. [Manual Setup](https://github.com/chiunam/CTAssetsPickerController/wiki/Manual-Setup-(v3))


## Usages

1. Import header

    ```` objective-c
    #import <CTAssetsPickerController/CTAssetsPickerController.h>
    ````

2. Create and present CTAssetsPickerController

    ```` objective-c
    // request authorization status
    [PHPhotoLibrary requestAuthorization:^(PHAuthorizationStatus status){
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            
            // init picker
            CTAssetsPickerController *picker = [[CTAssetsPickerController alloc] init];
        
            // set delegate
            picker.delegate = self;
            
            // Optionally present picker as a form sheet on iPad
            if (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad)
                picker.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationFormSheet;
            
            // present picker
            [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];
        });
    }];
    ````

3. Implement didFinishPickingAssets delegate

    If the picker is presented by `presentViewController:animated:completion:` method, the delegate is responsible for dismissing the picker when the operation completes.

    ```` objective-c
    - (void)assetsPickerController:(CTAssetsPickerController *)picker didFinishPickingAssets:(NSArray *)assets
    {
    // assets contains PHAsset objects.
    }
    ````

## Questions, Issues and Suggestions

Please check with [wiki](https://github.com/chiunam/CTAssetsPickerController/wiki/) and [issues](https://github.com/chiunam/CTAssetsPickerController/issues) for common issues and questions. Please open a [new Issue] (https://github.com/chiunam/CTAssetsPickerController/issues/new) if you run into a problem specific to the picker. Bug reports and pull requests are always welcome.

## Bonus

You may reuse the preview feature of the picker to view any assets. Just init a `CTAssetsPageViewController` with an array of assets and assign `pageIndex` property. Please refer to the [demo app](https://github.com/chiunam/CTAssetsPickerController/wiki/Running-demo-app) for the details.

```` objective-c
NSArray *assets = @[asset1, asset2, asset3, ...];
CTAssetsPageViewController *vc = [[CTAssetsPageViewController alloc] initWithAssets:assets];
vc.pageIndex = assets.count - 1; // display the last asset 

[self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];
````
